    <h3>What is asynchronous JavaScript? Why is it needed?</h3>
    <p>Asynchronous JavaScript means JavaScript can perform long-running tasks (like fetching data from a server,
        reading files, or waiting for a timer) without stopping the execution of the rest of the code.</p>


        <p>JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it can do only one task at a time.

If JavaScript were only synchronous:

The browser would freeze

The UI would become unresponsive

Users would have a bad experience

Asynchronous JavaScript solves this problem.</p>

<h3>What is callback hell? Why is it a problem?

</h3>
<p>Callback Hell is a situation where multiple nested callbacks are written inside one another to handle asynchronous operations.

This creates code that looks like a pyramid or arrow shape, making it hard to read and maintain.</p>
